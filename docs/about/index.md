# About Me

## Intro

Hey, I'm Prakash Odedra!
I'm currently working as Principal Consultant, but my background is varied, ranging from startups to big organisations, with roles as a network engineer, developer, devops and co-founder.

I like delving into architecting, creating solutions for new projects and ultimately just enjoy playing with new tech!

I get several things wrong, multiple times a day so feedback/corrections are welcome üòÅ

## Motivations

I'm ultimately starting this for two reasons; the first is rather simple, to share knowledge (non-selfish reason).

The second is perhaps more of a motivating factor, the more life progresses, the more I can feel myself becoming comfortable. This isn't necessarily a bad thing but comfort has a tendency to make me lazy/unmotivated.

Work-life balance is great, but I do enjoy my work and so I never really saw them as two seperate entities.
Again with time comes a refocussing of priorities and almost a distinction between the two, so this acts as a reminder to keep learning, keep sharing and to dedicate some time during the week to ensuring the passion for learning new fun things isn't lost while the scales balance out.

p.s I also enjoy podcasts, horror films, binge worthy tv shows as well as occassionally re-watching episodes of the office!

Thats enough typing for one day...
